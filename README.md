# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project is a simple machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient medical data. It was created as part of my internship, where I explored real-world datasets and learned how to build predictive models using Python.

The model uses **Logistic Regression**, a commonly used algorithm for binary classification problems. The goal is to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not, based on features like age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, etc.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `heart.csv`, which contains several medical features and a target column indicating the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 What this Project Covers

- Loading and exploring medical data
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset
- Separating features and target
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a **Logistic Regression** model
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy score
- Building a simple prediction system

## 📈 Results

The model achieves good accuracy on both training and test data. It can serve as a basic prototype for detecting heart disease using machine learning.

## 🧠 Try It Yourself

You can test the model with your own data by modifying the `input_data` section at the bottom of the notebook.
Make sure to import the heart.csv file which is included within this github repository into the import files of the notebook.
